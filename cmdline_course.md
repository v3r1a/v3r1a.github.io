Command line tools for linguists is an introductory course that gives the students the basic skills to be able to 
work in a Unix-like environment.

### Week 1: Introduction to Command Line Environments

During the first week we learned how to use some of the most basic Unix commands such as:

- cat for looking at files: `cat somefile.txt`

- cp for copying files: `cp file1 file2`

- mv for renaming files: `mv file1 file2`

- wget for downloading content from the web: `wget http://somewebsite.com/someimage.jpg`

We also began to work a little bit on a Project Gutenberg book, which helped us learn some emacs skills. I found the 
first week very gentle an introduction to the topic and I would imagine that someone who's never seen a command line 
before wouldn't be too intimidated either.

### Week 2: Navigating a Unix System

During the second week we expanded on the knowledge we had gained to start working with directiories. We also learned 
about permissions and how to give them to users - or take them away. We also tried to get used to navigating in the 
different directories inside a Unix system as well as experimented more with files. We also continued working with 
corpora, which was a nice touch in order to make the course more oriented toward linguists.

### Week 3: Basic Corpus Processing

The third week made us dive deeper into the world of corpus processing, which of course was very useful for a linguist 
starting on her Master's Thesis. We also learned to manipulate textfiles with command such as tr. Furthermore, we got to 
extract relevant information from a file, cutting out all the irrelevant information. I've found all the corpus 
related tasks especially useful. Even if I wouldn't use command line to handle corpora in the future, it is always 
good to learn something about the mindset needed for corpus processing.

### Week 4: Advanced Corpus Processing

We continued with similar themes as the week before. We got more experience with manipulating text with commands like 
tr and finding information with commands like wc, or egrep. We were also introduced piping, which makes executing more 
complex tasks perhaps a bit faster when you can just execute every command you need to at the same time. 
I found this week's tasks fun and again quite useful for a linguist.

### Week 5: Scripting and Configuration Files

As the title suggests, we learned to create simple scripts in command line as well as updating our .bashrc files. Once 
again the script creation felt really useful. The syntax was a bit different from what I'm used to, but it's always 
nice to get to widen your horizons. Some of the changes I made to my .bashrc file I actually kept after week 5, because 
they helped make my prompt a bit more user friendly.

### Week 6: Installing and Running Programs

I found the things I learned during week 6 to be some of the more useful ones. It was also nice to use python in my 
prompt for a change, as I usually use another program for it. We were also introduced a couple of linguistics related 
programs: guess_language, and BLLIP parser. Both were quite fun and something I would like to take another look at some 
day.

### Week 7: Version Control

The final week was all about GitHub. We created our own accounts there (here?) and learned to use a local repositories 
to manage our files. We got to try out several different ways to interact with GitHub, such as how to reverse a commit. 
We also made a one last visit to Project Gutenberg books.

### Final Assignment: Building Webpages using GitHub Pages

You are currently visiting my final assignment! We were supposed to create a homepage for ourselves (or a made-up 
person, which is the route I chose) using GitHub pages. I found the task quite fun, as I liked building websites as 
a kid. I will definitely continue working with my site, and want to especially learn more about changing the layout. 
All in all it has been quite useful to get better acquainted with GitHub, as I have ran across it quite a few times 
during my university career and have always been a bit uncertain about it.
