## Command line tools for linguists

(https://v3r1a.github.io/assets/img/commandline.png)

Command line tools for linguists is an introductory course that gives the students the basic skills to be able to 
work in a Unix-like environment.

### Week 1: Introduction to Command Line Environments

During the first week we learned how to use some of the most basic Unix commands such as:

- cat for looking at files: `cat somefile.txt`

- cp for copying files: `cp file1 file2`

- mv for renaming files: `mv file1 file2`

- wget for downloading content from the web: `wget http://somewebsite.com/someimage.jpg`

We also began to work a little bit on a Project Gutenberg book, which helped us learn some emacs skills. I found the 
first week very gentle an introduction to the topic and I would imagine that someone who's never seen a command line 
before wouldn't be too intimidated either.

### Week 2: Navigating a Unix System

During the second week we expanded on the knowledge we had gained to start working with directiories. We also learned 
about permissions and how to give them to users - or take them away. We also tried to get used to navigating in the 
different directories inside a Unix system as well as experimented more with files. We also continued working with 
corpora, which was a nice touch in order to make the course more oriented toward linguists.

### Week 3: Basic Corpus Processing

The third week made us dive deeper into the world of corpus processing.
