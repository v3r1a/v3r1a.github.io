## Introduction

Welcome to my homepage! I am a person totally made up for the course 'Command line tools fot linguists' taught at the 
University of Helsinki, Finland. As I am not real, I may claim that I study creaturology as my major. I specialise in 
forest demons and fairyfolk. I am currently writing my Master's Thesis on the political conflicts among said species 
in the national parks of Southern Finland.

Being imaginary, I can also claim that my study is supported by George Clooney, Elves of the Southern Hemisphere, 
and the Pope.
